The **[Cerro Blanco](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerro_Blanco_(volcano) "Cerro Blanco (volcano)")** is a [caldera](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caldera "Caldera") in the [Andes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andes "Andes"), located in Argentina's [Catamarca Province](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catamarca_Province "Catamarca Province"). Part of the Andes' [Central Volcanic Zone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andean_Volcanic_Belt#Central_Volcanic_Zone "Andean Volcanic Belt"), it is a volcano collapse structure located at an altitude of 4,670 metres (15,320 ft) in a depression. It has been active for the last eight million years and its eruptions have created several [ignimbrites](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ignimbrite "Ignimbrite"). An eruption 73,000 years ago formed the Campo de la Piedra Pómez ignimbrite layer, while another eruption in 2,300 ± 160 BCE became the largest volcanic eruption of the Central Andes, and reached the highest level in the [Volcanic Explosivity Index](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volcanic_explosivity_index "Volcanic explosivity index"), ejecting an estimated 170 cubic kilometres (41 cu mi) of [tephra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tephra "Tephra"). This eruption led to the formation of the most recent caldera, as well as thick ignimbrite layers. However, the Cerro Blanco has been dormant since then, although some [deformation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deformation_(volcanology) "Deformation (volcanology)") and geothermal activity have been recorded. The volcano is also known for giant [ripple marks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ripple_marks "Ripple marks") that have formed on its ignimbrite fields.
